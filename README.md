# Inferring cell-specific gene regulatory networks from single cell gene expression data

## Description
Inferring cell specific GRN using single-cell gene expression data generated by softODE simulator

* `src` stores the inference algorithms including baseline.
* `test` stores the running script `softODE_test` for Dynamic GRN inference
* `simulator` stores softODE simulator `soft_boolODE` and running script `run_simulator`
* `data` stores the gene expression data
  * sample data is not uploaded because of space limit, and it is available after running simulator in local
